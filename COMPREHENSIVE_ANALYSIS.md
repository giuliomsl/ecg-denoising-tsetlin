### ‚ùå FAILED APPROACH: ADVANCED FEATURE ENGINEERING
Multiple attempts at feature engineering proved to be detrimental to the model's performance.

**Attempt 1: Statistical Features from Windows**
- **Method**: Extracted 33 statistical features (mean, std, derivatives, etc.) from signal windows.
- **Result**: **FAILURE**. Correlation dropped to -0.005 (uninformative). Performance degraded by 569%.
- **Reason**: The aggregation of statistical features removes critical spatio-temporal information that the RTM relies on.

**Attempt 2: F-score Selection + PCA**
- **Method**: Selected the top 2,000 features (out of 102,400) using F-score, followed by PCA to 500 components.
- **Result**: **NO LEARNING**. Correlation was 0.000.
- **Reason**: Excessive preprocessing destroyed the signal's essential patterns.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è INEFFECTIVE APPROACH: ENSEMBLE RTM
- **Configuration**: An ensemble of 5 RTM models with varying parameters.
- **Result**: **PERFORMANCE DEGRADATION**. The ensemble's best MSE was 1.533 (a 6.46% degradation compared to the baseline). The correlation also dropped significantly.
- **Reason**: The models in the ensemble were not diverse enough to provide a benefit. The baseline configuration already represented a strong local/global optimum, and averaging with weaker models worsened the outcome.

## üß† KEY SCIENTIFIC INSIGHTS

1.  **Direct Representation is Superior for RTM**
    - The RTM excels when working with a direct, binarized representation of the raw signal.
    - Complex, hand-crafted feature engineering pipelines remove the very patterns the RTM is designed to learn. "More features" does not mean "better performance" for this architecture.

2.  **Task-Specific Learning is Crucial**
    - ECG denoising requires capturing complex spatial patterns within the signal's waveform.
    - Standard statistical features fail to represent these dynamics, leading to a low correlation between the features and the noise target.

3.  **The Baseline Configuration is Robust**
    - The systematic hyperparameter tuning successfully identified a strong optimum.
    - The failure of ensemble methods to improve upon this indicates that the single model configuration is already well-generalized and has likely reached its performance saturation point.

## üöÄ FINAL RECOMMENDATIONS & FUTURE WORK

### üéØ IMMEDIATE IMPLEMENTATION (HIGH PRIORITY)
1.  **DEPLOY THE OPTIMAL BASELINE CONFIGURATION**
    - Use Strategy S5 with RTM(clauses=400, T=10000, s=3.0, btpf=0).
    - Use the pre-binarized data (`_BINARIZED_q100.npy`).
    - Expected performance: RMSE ~1.20, SNR improvement ~+0.57dB.
2.  **IMPLEMENT A MONITORING SYSTEM**
    - Track key metrics: MSE, RMSE, SNR, and Correlation.
    - Employ K-fold cross-validation for robust validation.
    - Use early stopping based on validation loss plateau detection.

### üî¨ FUTURE RESEARCH (MEDIUM PRIORITY)

#### A. Data Augmentation & Robustness
- Explore techniques not covered in this project, such as noise injection, temporal shifts, amplitude scaling, and cross-domain data from other ECG datasets to improve model robustness.

#### B. Intelligent Post-processing
- Investigate adaptive filters based on RTM confidence, intelligent signal smoothing, or hybrid approaches that combine RTM with traditional filters to refine the denoised output.

#### C. Advanced RTM Architectures
- If new RTM variants become available, explore concepts like weighted clause voting, hierarchical RTMs, or attention mechanisms to focus on specific signal regions.
