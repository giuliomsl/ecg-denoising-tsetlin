# ECG Denoising with Regression Tsetlin Machines (RTM)

This project focuses on developing and optimizing a Regression Tsetlin Machine (RTM) for denoising Electrocardiogram (ECG) signals. The primary goal is to effectively remove common artifacts like baseline wander (BW), motion artifacts (MA), and powerline interference (PLI) while preserving the underlying physiological information of the ECG signal.

## 🔧 Core Pipeline Steps

1.  **`load_ecg.py`**: Loads and visualizes clean ECG signals from the MIT-BIH database.
2.  **`generate_noisy_ecg.py`**: Adds synthetic noise (BW, MA, PLI) to the clean signals and calculates the initial Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR).
3.  **`s5_rtm_preprocessing.py`**: Segments the signals into windows (e.g., 1024 samples, ~3 seconds) and binarizes them using thermometer encoding, preparing them for the Tsetlin Machine.
4.  **`s5_rtm_train.py`**: Trains the Regression Tsetlin Machine on the binarized data to predict and subsequently remove the aggregated noise.
5.  **`ecg_dataset.py` & `ecg_utils.py`**: Helper modules for loading binarized datasets and performing common tasks like SNR calculation and plotting.
